testwinfuncs1.scm
	Test the window functions, both with an argument and without.
	The window name/class/command is written to stdout.
	
testwinfuncs2.scm		test window functions
	Test the window function without arguments.
	The window name/class/command is displayed using xmessage.

testcondition1.scm	simple tests of conditions
	Depending on the class of the window do different things.
	Also, show how commands can vary depending on history.

testcondition2.scm	more simple tests of conditions
	Depending on the class of the window do different things.



remap1.scm		simple unconditional remapping using xdotool
	This maps the q key into an a
	Running xdotool from xbindkeys usually requires a delay, and this
	file allows easily finding a suitable value.

remap2.scm		remapping using xdotool
	Turn every other a into a b

remap3.scm		another simple conditional remapping using xdotool
	Test changing keys conditionally depending on the current window class.

remap4.scm		more  conditional remapping using xdotool
	Here we test that if the condition fails the original event is seen



emacsbindings.scm	a realistic example (finally!)
	Here we rebind some emacs keys unless we are already in a window that
	already has emacsbindings (emacs, xterm, ...)
